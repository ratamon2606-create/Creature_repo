# Creature Battle Project (OOP + Git Branching Practice)

This project is designed to help me learn **object-oriented programming** in Python — especially **inheritance** — while also practicing key **Git concepts** like branching, merging, conflict resolution, and version history.  
  
I will begin with a base class (`Creature`) and create additional subclasses on separate Git branches to simulate a real development workflow.

## Learning Objectives

### Python / OOP
- Understand and implement **classes**  
- Use **inheritance** to extend behaviors  
- Override and extend methods (e.g., `attack()`)  
- Practice writing simple test code in `main`  

### Git / Version Control
- Create and switch branches  
- Merge branches into `main`  
- Resolve merge conflicts  
- View commit history (`git log --graph --all`)
